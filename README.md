## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 8 or later
- Maven 3.0 or later

## Maven Dependencies

In order to be able to work with Spring MVC, let's deal with the Maven dependencies first:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.6.RELEASE</version>
<dependency>
```

To get the latest version of the library, have a look at [spring-webmvc on Maven Central.](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-webmvc)
